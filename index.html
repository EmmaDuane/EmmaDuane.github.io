            <p>My first experience with web design was creating a working prototype of a band site for a 
                local music artist. Using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, I designed an interactive website that 
                features an art forum, music forum, and multiple pages showcasing the artist's music and talents. 
                To upload and store forum submissions, I used PHP and MySQL Workbench. In order to make the site
                fully functional, I plan to finish adding functionality for user accounts and implement email notifications. 
                Although this project started as a way to practice web design, it's evolved into a long-term collaborative 
                project between myself and the artist.  You can check out the code for this project 
                <a href="https://github.com/emmaduane/First-band-site/tree/main/tent8cle%20t%20webpage">here</a>. <br><br>
                
                This Spring, I had the opportunity to be a part of the ICSSC Fellowship offered by UCI's school of Information 
                and Computer Science student council. Throughout this fellowship, I've worked on several projects that've 
                helped to strengthen my web development skills and that've provided me with experience using JavaScript with React.
                I've also had the opportunity to dabble with APIs as well as begin creating my very own personal website 
                using what I've learned throughout the fellowship. You can check out the code for this project 
                <a href="https://github.com/emmaduane/emmaduane.github.io">here</a>.<br><br>
                
                This quarter at UCI I'm taking classes in data management (using mySQL), OS theory,
                and human-computer interaction. Outside of the classroom, I'm continuing to work on my personal webpage and 
                using online resources to learn Python. In the future, I'd love to learn more about full stack
                development, Linux, and cloud computing.

            <p>
                Before transferring to UC Irvine, I attended El Camino College. Attending community college
                gave me the time I needed to explore my interests and eventually take my first computer science
                course! During my first semester, my English professor offered me a position as a 
                tutor/teaching assistant for her class through a program called Peer-Assisted Study Sessions 
                (PASS). The director of PASS extended me an offer to tutor for other courses, which 
                is how I ended up assisting students in calculus, general physics, and entry-level 
                programming courses. Creating lesson plans and facilitating group sessions were my 
                primary responsibilities, but motivating and challenging other college students was the most
                meaningful part of this experience. <br><br>

                This Summer, I will be interning at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as a tech consulting intern. 
                I'm very excited to begin training for this position in June, and can't wait for the opportunity
                to work alongside industry professionals to provide tech solutions to PwC clientele.

            <h3 class="sectionTitle">About Me</h3>
            <p>  
                While attending community college, I enrolled in an entry level programming course with the expectation
                that I would NOT be good at it. That being said, it was the first class that I truly enjoyed and the next 
                semester I immediately enrolled in a data structures course. From there I changed my major and decided to 
                pursue my new love for programming. <br><br>
                When my face isn't buried in a computer screen, it's often buried in books or comics. 
                That being said, a lot of what I love most involves being outside and around nature. 
                The photos on the right are images that I've taken on my adventures to Madrona Marsh Nature
                Preserve and the Monteray Aquarium. Other hobbies of mine include painting,
                creating digital art, and caring for my many, many plants.
